# github-repo-search

A Chrome extension for searching within Github repos.

This extension adds two simple features to github:

On public repos, you get the "Search source code..." box that already exists on private repos.

'/' is bound as a keyboard shortcut to highlight the repo search box for both public and private repos.

## Bugs

Sometimes search just won't work this might have to do with repo-specific searches relying on an occasionally rebuilt index. When using the repo:xxx searchquery global search format, you get an error message, but here you just don't get any results.
